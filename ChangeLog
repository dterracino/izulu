1.0
    * Remove-woeid parameter. Add --latitude LAT:LON, short form -l, to set the position 
      alternatively to -c. 
    * Remvoed some weather substates, see the readme or the manual for the new list
    * Added forecast icon for wind and fog
    * Fix weather API by moving to dark sky forecast api via a custom server. Note that 
      the server is heavily rate limited as the api calls per day are very limited, and
      results are cached for half an hour.
0.5:

      it possible to use the temperature display with DEs like unity that would otherwise
      cover the default position with a taskbar or similar.

    * Show the day of the forecast icon

    * (Note: Moved project to github)

     * REMOVED: YAHOOID from the config
